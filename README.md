An app to increase student involvement at university and allows students to be aware of all types of clubs, school hosted and club hosted events happening on campus.

Note that this app is still currently in development and in its early stages. However, the foundation of the application has been laid out and more progress will be made as time goes on. Currently, the user authentication system works (logging in and out of an account as well), CRUD actions for clubs, users, and categories, ability for a user to register an account (with form validations), joining and leaving clubs, viewing their account information on their profile page. User passwords have been secured with the bcrypt-gem. Admin users will be able to access CRUD actions for users, clubs and categories.
